-- *COHORT FRAME
-- The cohort CTE builds the enrollment window for patients entering and exiting the SCD cohort. The enrollment window is based on SCD forms with visit types of 'initial visit' and 'Discharge visit', matching all initial visit forms to the cooresponding patient discharge visit form, if present. If an individual patient has more than one initial visit form, then the patient discharge visit form will be matched to the initial visit form where the patient discharge visit form date falls between the first initial visit date and the following initial visit date.
